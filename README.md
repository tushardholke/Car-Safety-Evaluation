# Car Safety Evaluation using Desision Tree and Random Forest

## Description
The Car Safety Evaluation project applies Machine Learning algorithms to predict the safety level of cars based on various features such as buying price, maintenance cost, number of doors, passenger capacity, luggage boot size, and safety ratings.
This project compares the performance of two powerful classification algorithms:
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
The goal is to analyze, train, and evaluate models to determine which algorithm provides better prediction accuracy.

## Features
- User interface with buttons for Stone, Paper, and Scissors.
- Computer generates random choices.
- Displays the outcome of each round: Win, Lose, or Tie.
- Real-time interaction with simple visual feedback.

## Technologies
- **HTML**: Defines the structure of the game.
- **CSS**: Handles the styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: Manages the game logic and interactions.

## How to Play
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/StonePaperScissors.git
2. Open index.html in your browser.
3. Click one of the choices: Stone, Paper, or Scissors.
4. The result will be shown on the screen, indicating whether you won, lost, or tied.
