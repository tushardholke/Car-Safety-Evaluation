# Car Safety Evaluation using Desision Tree and Random Forest

## Description
The Car Safety Evaluation project applies Machine Learning algorithms to predict the safety level of cars based on various features such as buying price, maintenance cost, number of doors, passenger capacity, luggage boot size, and safety ratings.
This project compares the performance of two powerful classification algorithms:
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

The goal is to analyze, train, and evaluate models to determine which algorithm provides better prediction accuracy.

## Problem Statement
Given multiple categorical features describing a car, predict its overall safety classification:
- Unacceptable
- Acceptable
- Good
- Very Good

This project demonstrates how tree-based algorithms handle categorical datasets effectively.

## Technologies
- Python
- Pandas – Data manipulation
- NumPy – Numerical operations
- Matplotlib / Seaborn – Data visualization
- Scikit-learn – Machine learning models

## Project Workflow
- Data Collection & Loading
- Data Preprocessing
- Encoding categorical variables
- Train-Test Split
- Model Training
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Model Evaluation
- Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report
- Performance Comparison
